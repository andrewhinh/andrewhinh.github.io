    <p>Here are some of the projects I've worked on:</p>
    <ul class="ul-spaced">

        <div>
          <li>
            <a href="https://cachechat.pagekite.me/">CacheChat</a>, a website
            to talk with GPT-3.5 about your data of any form at crazy-fast
            speeds using only Numpy and the OpenAI API.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I built it in two days in preparation for an "Everything GPT"
              workshop I hosted for the
              <a href="experiences.html">Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).</a>

        <div>
          <li>
            <a href="https://captafied.ngrok.io/">Captafied</a>, a website
            that helps users understand their spreadsheet data without the
            learning curve of data processing and visualization tools such as
            Excel or Python.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I built the MVP in one week and created a production-grade
              website with two <a href="experiences.html">ACM</a> members
              within five weeks, which led to an internship offer from
              <a href="experiences.html">Procurement Sciences.</a>

          <li>
            <a href="https://admirer.pagekite.me/">Admirer</a>, a website that
            uses webcam feeds to answer open-ended questions requiring outside
            knowledge.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I built the MVP as a final project for the Full Stack Deep
              Learning (FSDL) 2022 course, where it was featured on the
              <a href="https://bit.ly/3h8CqlX">project showcase</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              I then created a production-grade website with
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiidenhovi/">Aleks Hiidenhovi</a>, an FSDL alum, as an entry for the

                Month of MLOps competition</a>, where we won the "Most Promising Entry" prize. We were
              invited by the ZenML team to document our work and progression
              as a <a href="https://bit.ly/3BZ4YpB">blog post</a>. Comments
              from Hamza Tahir, co-creator of ZenML, about our project can be

              href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andrewhinh/CheXRay-v2/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fproduction.ipynb?voila-theme=dark">CheXRay</a>,
            a website that uses chest x-rays to generate detailed diagnoses
            for patients with lung diseases.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I used around eight percent of the training set from the
              MIMIC-CXR dataset to train two models: a report generation model
              that achieves a Bleu4 score of 0.0704 and a diagnosis model with
              a precision of .545 and a recall of .824. As a comparison,
              <a href="https://bit.ly/3SUP5qA">this contemporary SOTA model</a>
              which I train as the report generation model uses the entire training set to achieve a Bleu4 score of
              0.103.
              The authors use
              <a href="https://bit.ly/3hXl4Jq">this NLP labeler</a>
              to achieve a precision of 0.333 and a recall of 0.273.

              Here's an example of a generated radiologist report (which can also be found on <a
                href="https://github.com/andrewhinh/CheXRay-v2">the GitHub page</a>):<br>
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                None. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The
                cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No acute cardiopulmonary process. Chest
                radiograph.
                No evidence of pneumonia. Chest radiograph. Chest radiograph. Chest radiograph. No acute cardiopulmonary

                Clearly, there's a way to go, but I'm proud of this performance given the limited resources I had at the
                time.
