              a website that <span class="title">uses chest x-rays to generate detailed diagnoses</span>
              for patients with lung diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of four iterations, I built and perfected this website for two reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>My family friend, a radiologist at Kaiser Permanente, was curious to see whether AI models could do
                his job, and I felt the urge to build a superior bot. No hard feelings remain to this day.</li>
              <li>I felt that this was a great way for me to not only apply what I'd learn in the online courses I took,
                but also learn how to test ideas in interesting papers for myself.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              In my <a href="https://github.com/andrewhinh/covid-pneumonia">first iteration</a>, I wanted to learn Keras
              and coincidentally stumbled across a chest x-ray disease dataset on Kaggle. I then built an image
              classifier to determine whether a person's chest x-ray is normal or contains COVID19, viral pneumonia, or
              bacterial pneumonia.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my <a href="https://github.com/andrewhinh/xray">second iteration</a>, I wanted to explore classifying
              even more diseases in addition to displaying a confidence level for the predictions. I then built a new
              image classifier to do just that.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my <a href="https://github.com/andrewhinh/chexray-v1">third iteration</a>, I wanted to apply what I'd
              learned in the 2020 edition of the fast.ai course and took a different approach to this problem. I decided
              to train two models: a report generation model based off of <a
                href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044">this research paper</a> that generates radiologist
              reports from the chest x-rays and a diagnosis model based off of <a
                href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/gradient-blending-for-multi-modal-models-in-progress/75645/12">this
                forum</a> that summarizes the generated report, the images, and other clinical data into a list of
              diseases the patient most likely needs to be checked out for. I even got the chance to work with a biology
              teacher at my high school to help me understand the technical details of x-rays and the diseases they can
              detect, which culminated in a presentation for the entire school to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my <a href="https://github.com/andrewhinh/chexray-v2">last iteration</a>, I used around eight percent
              of the training set from the MIMIC-CXR dataset to improve the two above-mentioned models. In the end, the
              report generation model achieved a Bleu4 score of 0.0704 and the diagnosis model achieved a precision of
              .545 and a recall of .824. As a comparison,
              <a href="https://bit.ly/3SUP5qA">this contemporary SOTA model</a>
              which I train as the report generation model uses the entire training set to achieve a Bleu4 score of
              0.103. The authors use
              <a href="https://bit.ly/3hXl4Jq">this NLP labeler</a>
              to achieve a precision of 0.333 and a recall of 0.273. Here's an example of a generated radiologist
              report:

              time.
